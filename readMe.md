This project aims to simulate and visualize the dynamic discharging process of a LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> single particle using phase field modeling.


[Experimental findings](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/full/10.1021/acsaem.0c00380) by Erichsen et al. show that during the discharging process of LiMn<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> electrode, it not only undergoes volumetric expansion, but also generates characteristic texture (i.e., laminate microstructures).
